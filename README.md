# Autonomous-Cars

A distributed vehicular communication platform implementing cooperative driving services over a VANET architecture.

---

## Overview

This project explores cooperative mobility through the design and implementation of a vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) supporting real-time information exchange between vehicles.

The system enables periodic awareness messaging and event-driven communication mechanisms, allowing vehicles to share location, state and traffic-related events in a decentralized manner.

---

## System Design

The platform was developed around the principles of C-ITS (Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems), focusing on:

- Periodic beaconing for neighborhood awareness  
- Event-triggered message dissemination  
- Geographic message propagation (geocast)  
- Distributed topology maintenance  
- Location-aware communication services  

The architecture follows a modular and concurrent design, separating communication services, mobility logic and message handling components.

## Implementation

The system was prototyped using Raspberry Pi-based vehicular units connected through ad-hoc networking.

Key aspects include:

- Configuration and management of wireless ad-hoc networks  
- Integration of communication services with vehicle motion control  
- Concurrent software structure for handling periodic and event-based services  
- Functional testing and validation through experimental scenarios
